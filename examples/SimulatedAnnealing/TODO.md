- Use Native Performance Ration computation
- Compare first plot (virtual best - training set - test set) with QUBO notebooks
- Compare native bootstrap resample results with QUBO notebooks boostrap results
- Draw conclusions from resource - input plots
- Define what metrics to be used when comparing the different solvers we will benchmark with window sticker.
