    "## Simulated Annealing (S.A.)\n",
    "\n",
    "S.A. is an optimization algorithm that works by navigating the input space and evaluating the objective function (energy) similarly to hill climbing. The main difference is that S.A. implements a strategy to avoid getting stuck in local optima.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea is to allow moves to a worse position, but in a structured way. When a candidate solution is selected, the probability of actually moving to the new position is determined by the change in the objective function and by a metric called **temperature**. When the temperature is high, the chance of performing a jump to a worse state increases, and the opposite happens when the temperature is low. By continuously decreasing the temperature during the execution of the algorithm, it can escape local optima during the first stages (high temperature), but it settles into a position towards the end of the execution (low temperature).\n",

    "**Case 1:**\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is always advantageous to move to a state with a better objective function. In this case, the probability is $P = 1$.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This formulation applies to a minimization problem. To solve a maximization problem, the only change is that $\\Delta E = E_{next} - E_{current}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temperature Decrease\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the temperature decreases during the algorithm's execution varies between implementations. This is referred to as the temperature **schedule**, which is a function of time or the number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** $\\beta = 1 / T$ is also commonly used in the implementation of the algorithm."
